function osignal = regularise_strobe(signal,rmode,mifd)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function regularises the strobe sequence 'signal' by dealing with overlaps.
%
% NOTE: 'signal' events must be sorted!
%
% Overlapping flashes are dealt with sequentially as follows:
%
% rmode == 1 : merge
% rmode == 2 : truncate
% rmode == 3 : ignore later flash (recommended)
% rmode == 4 : ignore earlier flash.
%
% mifd is the minimum inter-flash duration in seconds; set to something like 10/fs,
% where fs is sampling frequency in Hz.
%
% Flashes are processed sequentially in time. Note that modes 3 and 4 preserve flash
% "on" durations; modes 1 and 2 may not.
