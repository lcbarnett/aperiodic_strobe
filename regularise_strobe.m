function osignal = regularise_strobe(signal,rmode)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function regularises the strobe sequence 'signal' by dealing with overlaps.
%
% NOTE: 'signal' events must be sorted!
%
% Overlapping flashes are dealt with sequentially as follows:
%
% rmode == 1 : merge/subsume
% rmode == 2 : always truncate
% rmode == 3 : ignore later flash
% rmode == 4 : ignore earlier flash.
